# README for CV LaTeX Template


## Project Overview


This LaTeX project provides a customizable and user-friendly CV template, designed to present professional and academic achievements in a clean, organized format. The template includes sections for education, research experience, publications, field experience, teaching, and more. 

The project uses the `article` document class for enhanced customization and flexibility. While specialized CV classes (e.g., `moderncv`) exist, the `article` class was chosen to allow greater control over layout and formatting options.

## Features
- **Custom Header and Footer**: Displays the page number and total number of pages (e.g., `1/4`).
- **Responsive Tables**: Uses `tabularx` to automatically adjust column widths.
- **Custom Section Titles**: Defines different styles for sections, subsections, and sub-subsections.
- **Hanging Indents**: Applied to publication sections for citation-style formatting and neat alignment.
- **Icons**: Uses `fontawesome` for social media icons (e.g., email, GitHub).
- **Line Spacing**: Customized for readability.
- **Hyperlinks**: URLs are clickable, and internal links are hidden for neat page navigation.

## Example: Adding a New Section

You can easily add new sections using the following structure:

```latex

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{2.5cm} X}
Year & \textbf{Role}, Organization, Location \\
     & Description of role or project.
